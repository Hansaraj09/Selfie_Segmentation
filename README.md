# Selfie Segmentation Application

I developed this application to selectively focus on important regions in webcam images. It leverages OpenCV, Mediapipe, Matplotlib and NumPy for image processing and employs Gradio for web deployment.

## Dependencies

1.OpenCV : It helps is capturing the feed through the webcam.
2.Mediapipe: It helps in pre-processing the captured image
3.Matplolib: It helps in plotting the image by setting up the axes.
4.NumPy: It helps in blurring or darkening the less important regions of the image.
5.Gradio: It is a simple application for used for creating web-application especially for jupyter notebooks.
